<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/reengineering-facebook-ais-deep-learning-platforms-for-interoperability/">announced</a>
that it will make some changes to its library, fully integrating
<a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/">Lightning</a> and <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a>.</p>

<p>PyTorch Lightning is a framework used for all engineering matters of a Deep
Learning model, for instance it can be used to simplify the training loops. It
recently
<a href="https://medium.com/pytorch/pytorch-lightning-1-0-from-0-600k-80fc65e2fab0">released</a>
its version 1.0 with a stable API. Lightning will also allow easy quantization,
checkpointing, and others.</p>

<p>For Hydra, Iâ€™m less sure what itâ€™s about, but it is

as a way to handle all the config files.</p>
