I"$<p>I had some issue formatting a <a href="https://bcrestel.github.io/tags">page</a> containing all tags used in the blog. All
the coding had already been done in a <a href="/2018/01/11/adding-tag/">blog post</a>
that I followed. However, instead of having all tags written next to each other
on the same line, they were placed on top of each other, which would take a lot
more screen space. I didnâ€™t really dig to the bottom of it, but it turns out
this can be fixed by defining the tag page as an html file, instead of a
markdown file (md).</p>
