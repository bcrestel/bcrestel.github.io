I"½<p>The main challent of tracking notebooks with git is that every time you
re-generate an output, git will keep track of that. It makes each commit large,
and hard to keep track of.
Fortunately, there is a script that removes the output prior to your commit. Iâ€™m
using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/nbstripout/">nbstripout</a>. You can turn it on by
doing, inside your git repo,</p>
<pre><code>nbstripout --install
</code></pre>
<p>and turn it off by doing</p>
<pre><code>nbstripout --install
</code></pre>
<p>It works great. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t behave super well when switching to
other branches where nbstripout was not applied; basically, it removes the
output from every notebook it fines, and then requires you to <code>git commit</code>
before you can switch out of that branch. Not great. So instead, I apply it
manually to the notebook that I want to commit. You can do so by typing</p>
<pre><code>nbstripout FILE.ipynb
</code></pre>
