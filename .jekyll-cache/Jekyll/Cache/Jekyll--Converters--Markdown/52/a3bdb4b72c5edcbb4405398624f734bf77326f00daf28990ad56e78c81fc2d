I"<p>Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that offer a convenient,
compact way of representing joint probability distribution. A Bayesian Network
consists of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that connects different parameters
(node), each edge indicating a dependence (an edge from node A to node B if
the variable A helps explain B). Each node (random variable) is associated a
distribution in the form of a Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD), the
condition being on all the parent of that node. By definition, Bayesian Networks
do not contain cycles. Which is not the case of Markov Random Fields. For that
reason, Bayesian Networks are most often used when one tries to understand a
causal relationship between the variables.</p>

<p>The construction of a Bayesian Networks involve at least 2 steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generating the structure of the DAG (i.e., what nodes are connected and in
what direction). That is what the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8157-dags-with-no-tears-continuous-optimization-for-structure-learning.pdf">DAGs with NO
TEARS</a>
algorithm does, in an efficient wayi (along with
<a href="https://github.com/xunzheng/notears">code</a>).</li>
  <li>Estimating the CPDs. This can be done by MLE or Bayesian estimation.</li>
</ol>

An in-between solution might be to look at the slides for these two

For sequential or temporal models, Dynamic Bayesian Networks were developped.
