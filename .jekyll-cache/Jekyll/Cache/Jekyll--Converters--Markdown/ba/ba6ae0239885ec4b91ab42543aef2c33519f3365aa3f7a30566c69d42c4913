I"¤<p>As described in a previous post, I am following the instructions posted on <a href="http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/">that
blog post</a>.<br />
First, we add the <code>collecttags.html</code> file on <code>_includes</code>.<br />
Next, we add that file in the header, <code>head.html</code>.<br />
After that step, we can display the tags in the front matter of each post. In
addition, a link was created to a webpage listing all posts using that tag.
Next, we need to define those pages. In the blog post linked above, the author
provides a Python script to generate these pages automatically. The addition of
the cloud of tags work just as described.</p>
