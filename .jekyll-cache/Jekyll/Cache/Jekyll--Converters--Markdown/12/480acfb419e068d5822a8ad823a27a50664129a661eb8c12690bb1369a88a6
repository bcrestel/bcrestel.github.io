<p>The goal of supervised learning is to use a set of measures, called inputs, to
predict some outputs. Inputs and outputs are sometimes also called</p>

<h2 id="categories-of-outputs">Categories of outputs</h2>
<p>Outputs can be of two types,</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>quantitative</strong>: outputs are numbers, with an ordering. Prediction with
 quantitative outputs is called <strong>regression</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>qualitative</strong>/categorical/discrete: outputs are sets, with not necessarily
an order relationship. Prediction with qualitative outputs is called
<strong>classification</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notations">Notations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Input variables are denoted by $X=\{X_j\}_j$ (vector).</li>
  <li>Outputs are denoted by $Y$ (<strong>quantitative</strong>) or $G$ (<strong>qualitative</strong>).</li>
  <li>Predicted or estimated quantities are marked with a hat.</li>
  <li>$X,Y,G$ are generic variables. The actual observed values are denoted in
 lowercase; the $i^\text{th}$ observed input value is $x_i$ (potentially a
vector).</li>
</ul>
