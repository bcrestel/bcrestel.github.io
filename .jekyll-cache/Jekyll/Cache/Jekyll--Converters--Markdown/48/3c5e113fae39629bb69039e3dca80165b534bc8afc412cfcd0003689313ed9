I"¡<p>It can be useful to pass environment variable from your local environment to
your Docker build. This situation happened when I had to pass pypi keys to
install specific packages.
But since Docker is encapsulated, you need to take a couple
of steps to make it happen. Note that Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re building your Docker
image through a <code>Dockerfile</code></p>
<ol>
  <li>You need to pass the environment variables to your build command using the
flag <code>--build-arg</code>. For instance,
    <pre><code>docker build --build-arg DOCKER_ENV_VAR=$MY_LOCAL_ENV_VAR -f Dockerfile -t my_image:my_tag .
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>You need to define these variables in your Dockerfile. Continuing on the
previous example, this would mean adding the following line in your
<code>Dockerfile</code>:
    <pre><code>ARG DOCKER_ENV_VAR
...
RUN apt-get install &lt;something&gt; --flag=$DOCKER_ENV_VAR
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
