I"o<p>Jupyter Notebook offer really neat extensions that can honestly transform your
experience working with notebooks.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-install">How to install</h1>
<p>First step is to install. There are different ways (<code>conda</code>, <code>pip</code>,
<code>poetry</code>,…). You can check out the documentation
<a href="https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">here</a>.
When you install <code>jupyter_contrib_nbextensions</code>, it will automatically install
<code>jupyter_nbextensions_configurator</code> (see
<a href="https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator">here</a>),
which provides a nice GUI to enable/disable the extensions.</p>

<p>The whole process is pretty easy, but there are 2 actions that you need to take
before having the luxury of enjoying all the goodies:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Activate the configurator
    <pre><code>jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user
</code></pre>
    <p>then</p>
  </li>
  <li>Activate the extensions
    <pre><code>jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
</code></pre>
    <p>I’m honestly not sure of the order. I did in that order, but maybe it doesn’t
matter.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
