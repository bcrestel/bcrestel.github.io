I"ô<p>If you have a Docker image running on a remote server, you can set up PyCharm to
use the python interpreter in that image locally.
To do so, you go to <code>Preferences &gt; Project &gt; Project Interpreter</code>. You then
select the <code>SSH Interpreter</code> option. Then you need to set up your connection,
indicate the right port.
There is more on this in this
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-remote-interpreters-via-ssh.html">article</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, once this all done properly, I was still having some issue with running
<code>pytest</code> with this ssh interpreter. <code>pytest</code> would point to my local path. I had
to define a path mapping between my local path and my remote path. To do so, you
go to <code>Preferences &gt; Project &gt; Project Interpreter</code>. Below the project
interpreter, you see <code>Path mappings</code>, and you can define one from your local to
your remote. After that, <code>pytest</code> should be able to find your test.</p>
