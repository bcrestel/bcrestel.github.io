<p>RNNs suffer from memory problems. The solution is to use gated neuron units,
i.e, neurons that have a complex systems of masks/filters/… that process the
information flowing in. A classical first read on the subject is <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">Colah’s blog
post</a>.
The main difference with a typical cell is the presence, in addition to the
input and the hidden state, of a cell state, intended to capture the long-term
memory of the network. That cell state is then modified through 3 gates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>forget gate layer: applies a pointwise multiplication to the cell state
with the output of a sigmoid, therefore deciding what values of the cell state to let flow.</li>
  <li>input gate layer: same step as above except that this will be applied to the
 output of a tanh cell, then added (pointwise) to the output of the forget gate
layer.</li>
  <li>output gate layer: decides what is output as a hidden state. The cell state is
 untouched after the forget and input gate layers, but the hidden state will be
passed through a tanh (between -1 and 1), then filtered by a sigmoid (pointwise
multliplication).
So in short, a LSTM unit decides what to keep from the cell state, how to update
some of the entries of the cell state, then from that state state what to output
as the hidden state.</li>
</ul>

<p>There exists of course variants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>peepholes: each or some of the gates can have direct access to the cell state</li>
  <li>couple forget &amp; input: only update (input) the entries you forgot (weights for
 forget and input are one minus the other)</li>
  <li>GRU: It combines the above idea (combine forget and input) with the</li>
  <li>combination of cell state and hidden state.</li>
</ul>
