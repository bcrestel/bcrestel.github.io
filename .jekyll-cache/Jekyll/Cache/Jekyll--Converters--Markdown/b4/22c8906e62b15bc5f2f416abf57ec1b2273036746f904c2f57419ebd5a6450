I"Q<p>If you want to serve this blog on your local machine, in the main directory,
type</p>
<pre><code>jekyll serve
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few features that I would like to add to this blog.</p>
<ol>
  <li>I would like to manage tags. This is handled in Jekyll with the gem
jekyll-tagging, but unfortunately this gem is not available on GitHub. However
it is possible to regenerate the tagging capacity in Jekyll, for instance
by following <a href="http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/">that link</a>.</li>
  <li>I would also need to have a summary page listing all posts. This is described
in <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole">this</a> blog post.</li>
  <li>And of course, I will need support for
<a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/307">MathJax</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A few useful references for markdowns syntax:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://gist.github.com/roachhd/779fa77e9b90fe945b0c">cheat-sheet for markdowns</a></li>
  <li>And another, <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">better one</a></li>
</ul>
