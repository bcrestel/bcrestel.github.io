I" <p>Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be a random sample from a population with mean $\mu$ and
variance $\sigma^2 &lt; \infty$. Any function of this
random sample is called a statistic, and the probability distribution of a statistic is
called the sampling distribution of that statistic.
In this note, we look at two important statistics.</p>

<h4 id="sample-mean">Sample mean</h4>
<p>The sample mean is defined as \[ \bar{X} = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \]
The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the mean of the distribution, i.e.,
\[ \mathbb{E}[\bar{X}] = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu\]
And the variance of the sample mean is
\(\begin{align} 
Var[\bar{X}] &amp; = \mathbb{E}[\left( \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\mu) \right)^2 ]
\notag \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{n^2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[ (X_i-\mu)^2] + \sum_{i j}
\mathbb{E}[(X_i-\mu)(X_j-\mu)] \right) \notag \\
Var[\bar{X}] &amp; = \frac{\sigma^2}n
\end{align}\)</p>

<h4 id="sample-variance">Sample variance</h4>
<p>The sample variance is defined as \[ (S_n^2=) S^2 = \frac1{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i -
\bar{X})^2 \]
The sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the distribution
the samples are taken from, i.e.,
\(\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[S^2] &amp; = \frac1{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \mathbb{E}[X_i^2] - \frac2n
\sum_{j=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i X_j] + \mathbb{E}[\bar{X}^2] \right) \notag\\
&amp; = \frac1{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \mu^2 + \sigma^2 - \frac2n (\sigma^2 + n
\mu^2 ) + \frac1{n^2} (n(\mu^2+\sigma^2) + (n^2-n)\mu^2) \right) \notag\\
\mathbb{E}[S^2] &amp; = \sigma^2
\end{align}\)
However, because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality#Measure-theoretic_and_probabilistic_form">Jensenâ€™s
inequality</a>,
\(\sqrt{S^2}\) is a biased estimator of the standard deviation of the distribution
we sampled from. Indeed, square root being strictly concave over its domain, we
have that \(\mathbb{E}[\sqrt{S^2}] &lt; \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[S^2]} = \sigma\) (unless
$\sigma=0$).</p>

<p>On the other hand, because square root is a continuous function over
$\mathbb{R}^+$, if $S^2$ is a consistent estimator (converges in probability),
$\sqrt{S^2}$ is also a consistent estimator (i.e., the bias disappears as the
number of samples grow). Using Chebychevâ€™s inequality, we see that
\[ \mathbb{P}[|S_n^2 - \sigma^2| \geq \varepsilon] \leq
\frac{Var[S_n^2]}{\varepsilon^2}, \notag \]
that is $S^2_n$ is consistent if $Var[S_n^2]$ goes to zero as the number of
samples increase.</p>

<p>Without a proof, one can show that with $\theta$ the fourth moment of the
underlying distribution, we have
\[ Var[S^2] = \frac1n (\theta - \frac{n-3}{n-1} \sigma^4) \]</p>

<h4 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis testing</h4>
<p>A common test for a random sample is to test the value of its mean.
To do so, we can use the statistic
\[ \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \]
where $\mu$ is the value of the statistic we test for.
For hypothesis testing, we need to know the distribution of that statistic. In
the general case, we can only conclude asymptotically as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit
theorem</a> states that if the
underlying distribution has finite variance, 
\[ \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,1) \]
In practice, $\sigma$ is rarely known, and we want to replace it with $S$. We
know that $S$ is a consistent estimator of $\sigma$, and we can show that $\sigma /
S \rightarrow 1$. 
Then by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slutsky%27s_theorem">Slutskyâ€™s theorem</a>,
\[ \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \frac{\sigma}{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,1) \]</p>

<p>However this result is only valid asymptotically. Often in practice, people
assume the asymptotic regime is valid, and use a standard normal distribution
for that statistic; but there is no general rule to know when that approximation
is valid.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the random samples come from a <em>normal distribution</em>
$\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$, we can say something more general. In that case,
\[ \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) \]
and
\[ \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{S / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1} \]
a Studentâ€™s t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedoms.</p>
