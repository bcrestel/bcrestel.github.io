I"<p>After upgrading to Catalina, I could not run <code>jekyll</code> locally to render that
website on my laptop. I was getting a weird error message about the ruby
interpreter being bad.</p>

<p>The solution is to use a different ruby interpreter, installed via Homebrew:
<code>brew install ruby</code>. Then update all your paths so that the command line will
default to this newly installed interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH="/Users/bencrestel/local/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
</code></pre>
<p>Once this is done, we can install the jekyll gem (and bundler, but I’m not sure
what that is): <code>gem install --user-install bundler jekyll</code>. Next, you add that
to your PATH</p>
<pre><code>export PATH="/Users/bencrestel/.gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin":$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>so that the right version of <code>jekyll</code> will be used. And you’re good to go.</p>
