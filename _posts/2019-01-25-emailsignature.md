title: Creating EAI signature on the Mail app
tags: mac
---

EAI's design team provides a nice HTML signature template that you can simply
paste into Google's Mail app. But it doesn't work on Mac's Mail app, which 
makes it surprisingly complicated to create an HTML signature. To make it
happen, you can follow the steps described in that
[tutorial](https://www.daretothink.co.uk/html-email-signature-in-apple-mail/).
On top of that, you will also need
an HTML version of EAI's email signature. This was kindly
done by the Design team, and can now be found on
[Confluence](https://elementai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UX/pages/693273903/Signature).
The only place where we differ from the tutorial is that instead of pasting part
of the HTML signature into the .mailsignature file, we need to delete
everything in the initial file, then paste everything from EAI's HTML file.
