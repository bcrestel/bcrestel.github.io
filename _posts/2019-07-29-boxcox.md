The [Box-Cox transformation](https://otexts.com/fpp2/transformations.html) is a parametric transformation that includes the
logarithmic transfomration as a special case, and is defined as

$$ w_t = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \log(y_t) , \text{ if } \lambda = 0 \\
& \frac{(y_t)^\lambda - 1}{\lambda} , \text{ otherwise}
\end{aligned} \right. $$

Quick node: the inclusion of the log-transformation is justified by the fact
that $(y_t)^\lambda \approx 1 + \lambda \log(y_t)$ when $\lambda \rightarrow 0$.

Assuming you get better distribution with $w_t$, you can run your inference on
that variable. But once this is done, you still need to revert it back to the
quantity of interest, that is $y_t$. The inverse Box-Cox transformation is given
by

$$ y_t = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \exp(w_t) , \text{ if } \lambda = 0 \\
& \left(\lambda w_t + 1 \right)^{1/\lambda} , \text{ otherwise}
\end{aligned} \right. $$

However, one needs to be careful about the distribution of the inverted
prediction~$y_t$. 
A general (non-parametric) way of handling this, and the way chosen by
[Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/backtransforming/), is to do a
Taylor expansion around the mean. That is, calling $f$ the inverted Box-Cox
transformation, and calling $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ the mean and variance of the
transformed variable $w_t$, we would have

$$ y_t \approx f(w_t) = f(\mu) + (w_t - \mu) f'(\mu) + \frac12 (w_t - \mu)^2
f''(\mu). $$ Then taking the mean of that expression, we get
$$ \mathbb{E}[y_t] = f(\mu) + \frac12 \sigma^2 f''(\mu). $$

However in the special case of the log-transformation, and if the
transformed variable $w_t$ was assumed to be normal (large class of models will
make that assumption when calculating the uncertainty around the mean), we can
simply use the results of a
[log-Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution), which tells
us that (1) $\exp(w_t)$ is the median of $y_t$, and (2) the mean of $y_t$ is
given by $\exp(\mu + \sigma^2/2)$. In the case $\sigma^2 \ll 1$, we recover the
expression derived from the Taylor expression.
