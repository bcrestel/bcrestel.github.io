# Start a local web server

* (optional) Start docker container and expose port 8000
`docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --entrypoint bash -w /home -v $PWD:/home default:1.0`
* Start web server using Python (use port 8000 by default)
`python -m http.server`
* Access that web site from another machine on my network
use URL `http://<local_ip_address>:8000`
you can find your local ip address by doing `ipconfig getifaddr en0` when conected to wifi.

Note that for some reason, you can't use `localhost` on Chrome and instead need to use `127.0.0.1`, which is the [same in the end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost#:~:text=The%20address%20127.0.,address%20for%20loopback%3A%20%3A%3A1.).
The answer to that [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33524826/localhost-not-working-in-chrome-127-0-0-1-does-work) question provides a fix.
