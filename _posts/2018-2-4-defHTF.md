title: Terminology and notations in supervised learning
tags: ML

## General
The goal of supervised learning is to use a set of measures, called inputs, to
predict some outputs. Inputs and outputs are sometimes also called

**inputs** | **outputs**
predictors | responses
independent variables | dependent variables
features |

## Categories of outputs
Outputs can be of two types,
* **quantitative**: outputs are numbers, with an ordering. Prediction with
 quantitative outputs is called **regression**.
* **qualitative**/categorical/discrete: outputs are sets, with not necessarily
an order relationship. Prediction with qualitative outputs is called
**classification**.

## Notations
* Input variables are denoted by $X=\\{X_j\\}_j$ (vector).
* Outputs are denoted by $Y$ (**quantitative**) or $G$ (**qualitative**).
* Predicted or estimated quantities are marked with a hat.
* $X,Y,G$ are generic variables. The actual observed values are denoted in
 lowercase; the $i^\text{th}$ observed input value is $x_i$ (potentially a
vector).
