Font awesome is an easy way to include cool icons to your website, like the one
for Github, Linkedin, or just email (see side bar). To use, all you need to do
is add
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```
the header of your html file. Then [choose](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_webapp.asp) 
the icon you want to use. You can modify the size of the icons by adding the
appropriate [option](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/styling/sizing-icons).
For instance, for a large Github icon, you would add
```html
<i class="fa fa-github fa-lg">
```
