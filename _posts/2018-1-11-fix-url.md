title: Fix some incorrect links

I had some issues with the links pointing to the main page in the sidebar. They would always point to the current page. I fixed this by changing `site.baseurl` to `site.url` in the definition of these two links (title and Home) in the file `_includes/sidebar.html`.  
Also, as I was looking for a solution to that problem, I found that all url's in Jekyll should really be defined as `{ { site.baseurl } }{ { post.url } }`, and the variable `baseurl` should be left empty, instead of `/`. I found [this page](http://downtothewire.io/2015/08/15/configuring-jekyll-for-user-and-project-github-pages/) to be pretty useful.
