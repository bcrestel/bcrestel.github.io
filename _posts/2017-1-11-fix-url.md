title: Fix some incorrect links

I had some issues with incorrect links in the sidebar of that blog. For
instance, when going to another page, the link for the home page was incorrect.
I fixed this by changing `site.baseurl` to `site.url` in the definition of the title and home
links in `_includes/sidebar.html`.  
As I was looking for a solution to that problem, I found that all url in
markdowns or html should really be defined as `{ { site.baseurl } }{ { post.url
} }`. Also the variable `baseurl` should be set to nothing, instead of `/`.
