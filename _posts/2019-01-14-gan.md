GANs are a popular types of generative models that attemps to approximate a
probabilty distribution. It does so by setting up a game between 2 agents, one
that is tasked with generating samples (the generator), and one that is tasked
with deciding whether samples generated are real or fake (the discriminator).
The tyical setup uses deep nets as both generator and discriminator, and each
have different cost functions. They are trained by alternating optimization
steps on each.

One criticism is that the distribution learned by GANs have a very-low support,
and therefore only learn a very subset of the target distribution. This is
discussed in [Do GANs actually learn the distribution? An empirical
study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08224).

There exists different architecture for GANs. In [Are GANs Created Equal? A
Large-Scale
Study](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7350-are-gans-created-equal-a-large-scale-study),
the authors compare different GANs and find no consistent, meaningful difference
among those. They also propose some ways to compare GANs; another paper in that
direction is [Assessing Generative Models via Precision and
Recall](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7769-assessing-generative-models-via-precision-and-recall).
