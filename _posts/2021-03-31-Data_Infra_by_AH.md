The VC company Andreessen Horowitz published a [blog post](https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/the-emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/) detailing different approaches to data architecture for AI/ML and business analytics. 
It highlights 2 main points: 1) architectures are growing increasingly complex, and 2) data is central. 
This last point is in line with a recent [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo) by Andrew Ng about MLOps, insisting about the need for a shift from model-centric AI to data-centric AI.
