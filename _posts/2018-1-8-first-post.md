If you want to serve this blog on your local machine, in the main directory,
type
```
jekyll serve
```

There are a few features that I would like to add to this blog.
1. I would like to manage tags. This is handled in Jekyll with the gem
jekyll-tagging, but unfortunately this gem is not available on GitHub. However
it is possible to regenerate the tagging capacity in Jekyll, for instance
by following [that link](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).
2. I would also need to have a summary page listing all posts. This is described
in [this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) blog post.
3. And of course, I will need support for
[MathJax](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/307).

A few useful references for markdowns syntax:
* A [cheat-sheet for markdowns](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/779fa77e9b90fe945b0c)
* And another, [better one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
