Poetry is a way to manage virtual environment in Python, a bit similar to
Anaconda.
The way it is being using in t-s is that there is a `pyproject.toml` file and a
lock file in the root of the repo, which means you can just `poetry install` to
create the virtualenv. By default, the "extras" dependencies will not be
installed. To install those, you instaed need to do `poetry install --extras "<name of
package>"`; this is equivalent to doing `poetry install` and on top of that
installing the extra dependencies requested.
When you update the version of certain dependencies, you can update you poetry
environment by doing `poetry install`.
To add new dependencies without modifying the `pyproject.toml`, you can do
`poetry add <name_of_dependency>`.

Once you're all set up, you can run some commands inside your virtual
environment. For instance, to run `ipython`, you would do
```
poetry run ipython
```
To start a jupyter notebook session, you would do
```
poetry run jupyter-notebook
```

Their [documentation](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/cli/) is pretty good.
