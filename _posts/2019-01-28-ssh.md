To set up a remote repo via ssh, you first need to change the address of that
repo. To do that, go on the page of that repo on the github website, select
Clone, then select via SSH. It will give you the address you need.

Then you need to setup SSH keys on Github. Go to your Settings, SSH and GPG
keys, and add you public SSH key.
Next, on your local machine, add your private key to your keychain, by doing
```
ssh-add <address of your private key>
```
You will need to add your private key to your keychain everytime you restart
your machine. You can check the content of your keychain by typing
```
ssh-add -l
```
