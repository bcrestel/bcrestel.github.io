You can pass local environment variables to your ssh session, and even use those
to define environment variables inside your ssh session. For that, you need to
execute a command which requires the flag `-t` prior to your server address. An
example,
```
ssh -p 2222 -A -t myname@myserver "SERVER_ENV_VAR=$LOCAL_ENV_VAR; export SERVER_ENV_VAR; bash -l"
```
After that, you should see an environemnt variable called `SERVER_ENV_VAR`
inside your ssh session.
