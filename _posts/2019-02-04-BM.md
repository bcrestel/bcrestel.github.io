title: Note on Brownian motion

I just want to summarize a few results that I find useful when dealing with
arithmetic and geometric Brownian motions.
For simplicity, I looked  at unitary time steps. If it's not the case (e.g., daily
rate of change, looked hourly), then some minor adjustment needs to be done.

## Arithmetic Brownian motion

The SDE for the ABM is given by
$$ dI_t = \mu I_0 d_t + \sigma I_0 dW_t $$

The solution is then
$$ I_d = I_0 (1 + \mu d + \sigma W_d) $$
where $W_d$ is a Brownian motion. This means the following moments for the
quantity $I_d$,

$$ \begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[I_d] & = I_0 (1 + \mu d) \\
\text{Var}[I_d] & = \sigma^2 I_0^2 d \\
\text{Cov}[I_d, I_{d'}] & = \sigma^2 I_0^2 \min(d,d') \\
\end{aligned} $$

## Geometric Brownian motion

You can find some info from Wikipedia, 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion)
and 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution).
The SDE for GBM is
$$ dI_t = \mu I_t d_t + \sigma I_t dW_t $$.
Then the solution is
$$ I_d = I_0 \exp \left( (\mu - \sigma^2/2)d + \sigma W_d \right) $$.
This means the following moments for the
quantity $I_d$,

$$ \begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[I_d] & = I_0 e^{\mu d} \\
\text{Var}[I_d] & = I_0^2 e^{2\mu d}(e^{\sigma^2 d} - 1) \\
\text{Cov}[I_d, I_{d'}] & = I_0^2 e^{\mu(d+d')} \left( e^{\sigma^2 \min(d,d')}
-1 \right)
\end{aligned} $$

For the covariance, you can derive it as

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{Cov}[I_d, I_{d'}] & = \mathbb{E}[I_d I_{d'}] - \mathbb{E}[I_d]
\mathbb{E}[I_{d'}] \\
& = I_0^2 e^{(\mu-\sigma^2/2)(d+d')} \mathbb{E}[e^{\sigma(W_d + W_{d'})}] - 
I_0^2 e^{\mu(d+d')}
\end{aligned} $$

And the last part is equal to $\mathbb{E}[e^Y]$ where $Y$ is 
[log-normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) 
with
parameters $\log Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2(d+d'+2\min(d,d')))$, such that
$\mathbb{E}[e^Y] = \exp[\sigma^2/2(d+d'+2\min(d,d')]$ and the result follows.

It is interesting to convert the variables $\mu, \sigma$ into the empirical
moments of the quantity $I_d$. This is

$$ \begin{aligned}
\mu & = \frac1d \log \frac{\mathbb{E}[I_d]}{I_0} \\
\sigma^2 & = \frac1d \log \left( 1 + \frac{\text{Var}[I_d]}{I_0^2 e^{2 \mu d}} \right)
\end{aligned} $$
