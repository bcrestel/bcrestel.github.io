I had some issue formatting a [page](https://bcrestel.github.io/tags) containing all tags used in the blog. All
the coding had already been done in a [blog post]({% post_url 2018-1-11-adding-tag %})
that I followed. However, instead of having all tags written next to each other
on the same line, they were placed on top of each other, which would take a lot
more screen space. I didn't really dig to the bottom of it, but it turns out
this can be fixed by defining the tag page as an html file, instead of a
markdown file (md).
