title: Passing environment variables to you Docker build
tags: docker
---

It can be useful to pass environment variable from your local environment to
your Docker build. This situation happened when I had to pass pypi keys to
install specific packages.
But since Docker is encapsulated, you need to take a couple
of steps to make it happen. Note that I'm assuming you're building your Docker
image through a `Dockerfile`
1. You need to pass the environment variables to your build command using the
flag `--build-arg`. For instance,
```
docker build --build-arg DOCKER_ENV_VAR=$MY_LOCAL_ENV_VAR -f Dockerfile -t my_image:my_tag .
```
2. You need to define these variables in your Dockerfile. Continuing on the
previous example, this would mean adding the following line in your
`Dockerfile`:
```
ARG DOCKER_ENV_VAR
...
RUN apt-get install <something> --flag=$DOCKER_ENV_VAR
```
