title: Adding tags on Github
tags: jekyll

As described in a previous post, I am following the instructions posted on [that
blog post](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).  
First, we add the `collecttags.html` file on `_includes`.  
Next, we add that file in the header, `head.html`.  
After that step, we can display the tags in the front matter of each post. In
addition, a link was created to a webpage listing all posts using that tag.
Next, we need to define those pages. In the blog post linked above, the author
provides a Python script to generate these pages automatically. The addition of
the cloud of tags work just as described.
