title: Installing cmake 3.17.3 inside a Docker image
tags: cmake docker
---

Installation of xgboost requires cmake of version at least 3.17.3. And apt-get
was only installing cmake 3.5.x, or something like that. A nice solution is
described in this [post](https://askubuntu.com/a/865294). I picked the second
approach, from the binary. This is the code I included in my Dockerfile:
```
RUN mkdir /opt/cmake && \
    cd /opt/cmake && \
    wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.17.3/cmake-3.17.3-Linux-x86_64.sh && \
    bash cmake-3.17.3-Linux-x86_64.sh --skip-license && \
    ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake && \
    echo $(cmake --version)
```
The last line is just to check that it's working.
Also, note that you can install different versions of `cmake`. You can find your
favorite one on their [website](https://cmake.org/download/).
