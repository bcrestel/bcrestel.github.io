## Running a Docker image

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 
is way to run a specific application without having to install it, or
compile it and deal with all the dependencies.
In Ubuntu, it was very easy to install the docker software from the command
line. On Mac, you can look at that [post](/2018/12/04/setupMac).
Once this is done, you need to identify the image you want to run. A Docker image
is a container a certain set of applications. To run that image, you can type in
the command line
```
docker run <image>
```
If you have never run that image before, the first time you execute that
command, docker will download the image and all other stuff it needs. If you
want to download the image without running it, you can instead do 
```docker pull <image>```.

A few options make the whole Docker experience a lot more useful. In
particular, you typically want that image to be opened in an interactive shell.
For that, you need the options ```-it```. Another useful feature is to be able
to access some folders of your local hard drive from within the image; this can
be done with the option ```-v LOCAL_FOLDER:DOCKER_FOLDER```.

For example, when running the Fenics Docker image, I would do
```
docker run -t -i -v /home/ben/Work/fenicstools:/home/fenics/fenicstools -v /home/ben/Work/hippylib:/home/fenics/hippylib fenics20171
```
to have access to my local ```fenicstools``` and ```hippylib``` folders.
In another example, to run a tensorflow Docker image, I did
```
docker run -t -i -v
/home/ben/Work/Programmation/Python/mlds/tensorflow/:/home/tf/
tensorflow/tensorflow bash
```
The bash was required here as by default the
[tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker) image starts a notebook.
Actually you start in the ```/notebook``` folder, and need to navigate to the
folder you defined ```cd ../home/tf```. But once you figure this out, everything
works great.

### Running a jupyter notebook using a Docker image

I found the solution in this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38830610/access-jupyter-notebook-running-on-docker-container) post. First you need to publish a port of the container to the host (your laptop),
```
docker run <...> -p 8888:8888 <your_image> bash
```
Inside your Docker image, you can start the jupyter notebook,
```
jupyter-notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
```
Now on your local machine, from your browser, navigate to ```localhost:8888/tree```. 
You will be prompted with a menu asking for a token. After starting the jupyter notebook, 
you'll get a http adress which contains the sequence ```:8888/?token=<...>```. 
Your token is made of all the alphanumeric characters following the equal sign.


## Creating a Docker image
You can save all the characteristics of the image you want to create in a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), then build the corresponding image by doing, if you're in the same directory as the Dockerfile,
```
docker build -t <name>:<tag> .
```
In my case, it couldn't run the image when I specified a tag; I could only pass a name.
Another way to build the image which may be more flexible is to use a ```docker-compose.yml``` file 
(see [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)) and execute it through
```
docker-compose up <name_specified_in_yml>
```
