Synthetic data generation is a very popular topic these days, and I believe for a good reason.
I found this blog [post](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/20/how-synthetic-data-could-save-ai/) that list a few places that already offer synthetic data generation.
Most of the applications listed are for computer vision or NLP, but there are few tabular applications which may be suitable for time series.

There was also this blog [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/synthetic-time-series-data-a-gan-approach-869a984f2239) from YData looking at the [Time GAN](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJeZq4reLS) paper from Cambridge.
