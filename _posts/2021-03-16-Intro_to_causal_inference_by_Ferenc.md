title: Intro to causal inference by Ferenc
tags: causality statistics
---

[Ferenc Huszar](https://www.inference.vc/) put together a series of 3 blog post to introduce different concepts of causal inference:
* [ML beyond Curve Fitting: An Intro to Causal Inference and do-Calculus](https://www.inference.vc/untitled/)
* [Illustrating Interventions via a Toy Example](https://www.inference.vc/causal-inference-2-illustrating-interventions-in-a-toy-example/)
* [Counterfactuals](https://www.inference.vc/causal-inference-3-counterfactuals/).

He mentions a fourth part dealing with "Causal Diagrams, Markov Factorization, Structural Equation Models", but I haven't seen anything related to it.
