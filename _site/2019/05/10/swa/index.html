  <h1 class="post-title">Bayesian inference in Deep Learning</h1>
  <span class="post-date">10 May 2019</span>
  <p>It is possible to perform full-on Bayesian inference in Deep Learning. One could
train a network, assume some sort of Gaussian distribution around the weights
that were found, and the likelihood comes directly from the loss function
since, in general, that loss function is derived from MLE. However, this is
costly, and in practice itâ€™s not clear whether people do that or not.</p>

<p>There has been some attempts at using variational inference, i.e., approximating
the posterior with a simpler distribution (e.g., Gaussian), by looking for the
candidate distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
the posterior and the candidate distribution. It also seems to be
computationally expensive.</p>

<p>The most popular option is to use Monte-Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout) at inference
time (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/PDFs/DLW_ICML_2015_dropout_bayesian_poster.pdf">here</a>).
The idea is to generate samples of the solution of the NN by randomly shutting
down a certain numbers of cells for each forward propagation. The author proves
some interesting properties of their methods.</p>

<p>More recently, Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) was introduced (see
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05407.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/stochastic-weight-averaging-in-pytorch/">blog
post</a>). 
SWA is not, so to speak, a new optimization algorightm, it simply modifies the
typical learning rate strategy (high learning rate, following by continuously
decreasing rate, until a very slow learning rate) to always maintain a
relatively large learning rate and continue to explore the loss function. And
after the training procedure, the latest weights, i.e., corresponding to the
exploration phase, are averaged out. That average is designed to position the
SWA weight in the middle of a large flat region (the authors assume that NN
minima are in large flat portions of the loss function), instead of close to the
edge (typical optim, e.g., SGD), leading to better generalization properties.
You have the option, in the exploration phase, to only includes a regular
sub-set of the weights.
There is potential issue when SWA is issued in conjunction with batch
normalization; because batch normalization learns the statistics of the
activation during training, but the SWA weights were never used during that
phase. The solution proposed by the authors is to re-pass the training set
through the network after training (i.e., with SWA weights), and re-calculate
the BN statistics at that time.</p>

<p>The authors also have an extension called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02476">SWA-Gaussian</a> (SWAG) that allows to
carry uncertainty quantification by estimating the first 2 moments of the weight
distribution, again based on snapshots of the exploration phase.</p>
